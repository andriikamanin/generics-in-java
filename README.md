## 🧩 **Introduction**

Generics, introduced in Java 5, provide:
- **Type Safety**: Prevent runtime errors.
- **Code Clarity**: Simplify logic.
- **Reusability**: Enable modular, reusable components.

Here’s a quick example:

```java
// Without Generics
List list = new ArrayList();
list.add("Hello");
String value = (String) list.get(0); // Requires explicit casting

// With Generics
List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
list.add("Hello");
String value = list.get(0); // No casting required
```
